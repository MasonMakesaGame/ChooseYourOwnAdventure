  DialogueText: "Finally, you\u2019ve made it. After weeks of travel, you\u2019ve
    reached your goal, the Warrens. Before you, you see the entrance. A gaping hole
    in the earth, a wound leaking ichorous curses across the land. As you peer into
    its depths, you see fleshy earth and cursed tendrils as far as the fading light
    of the day will allow. Rough wooden planks, protruding from the pus-like earth
    form a rough pathway forward.  "
