  DialogueText: "As you emerge from the tunnel, it takes a moment for your eyes to
    adjust to the darkness. Any remnants of light that may have leaked from the knight's
    hovel have dissipated. As your vision clears, you scan the room for anything
    identifiable. Those same twisted rooms seem to have grown even more human-like.
    In a few, you swear you can see eyes. There is only one tunnel forward, and trailing
    out of that tunnel you see loose, dirty feathers. \n"
