  DialogueText: "As you squeeze free from what you feel may be your final tunnel,
    the first thing you notice is the smell. Your mind plunges into a memory of when
    your father showed you your castle\u2019s oubliette. A completely unique smell,
    the combination of rot, dust and dank stone. The smell of something long and
    cruelly forgotten. Something still lingering. A new texture covers the walls
    you can see. No more leering root faces, but not quite dirt or rock. Something
    almost membranous. Before you lies your goal. A ruined body, an obelisk of flesh.
    Vertebral structures covered in blind, leaking eyes trace the length of the structure,
    culminating in a spinous crown atop a blasphemous head. The beings form seems
    to be fused into the antechambers walls, stretched and pocked."
