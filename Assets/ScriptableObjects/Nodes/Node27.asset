  DialogueText: "This, this is mine, little one. I thought I had long since lost
    the last of them. When I fell here, they began to shed, and dissolve. I never
    thought I would see one again. The walls of the chamber begin to shift and flex,
    then suddenly, open. Above the both of you, you see the night sky stretch out,
    full of glittering stars. That beautiful view, framed by the creature's massive
    wings. I once flew among those glittering sparks. I haven\u2019t thought of them
    in so long. Thank you, little one. A kind memory you\u2019ve given me. Leave
    in peace, and know that while your kind will never be free of curses, you have
    lifted a weight, for a time. Climbing out of the pit, you look back to the face
    of the being. The last thing you see as it closes its wings back around itself
    is a soft, relieved smile. "
