  DialogueText: Exiting the tunnel, you nearly have to yank yourself free, the dirt
    having closed so tight to your body. As you fall from the tunnel, your eyes land
    on the twisting roots around you. Mere inches from you, a face. Seemingly made
    of roots, but so, so human. This pattern repeats across every inch of the wall
    you can see. The swirling in your skull feels almost overwhelming. Before you,
    you see a singular tunnel forward. On the ground before that tunnel, you see
    a singular large white feather. It exudes a sense of deep, old power.
