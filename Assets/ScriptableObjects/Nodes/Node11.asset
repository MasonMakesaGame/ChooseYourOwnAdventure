  DialogueText: This new room is much smaller than any before it. A pulsing heat
    seems to emanate from the walls. Before you lies another tunnel forward, and
    laying tucked into another small alcove you see a small feathered shape. It's
    a Wylderborn, beings known for their habit of collecting curses.
