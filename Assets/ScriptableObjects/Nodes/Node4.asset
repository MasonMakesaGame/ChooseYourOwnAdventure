  DialogueText: "As you draw near the knight, you see the subtle rise and fall of
    their breastplate. They're still alive. From between the gaps in the armour inky
    tendrils of curse boil forth, and tunnel into the walls and floor around the
    poor creature. You can see, in the dim light of the weakening candles, that these
    tendrils are escaping from the flesh itself, covering the knights very eyes.
    \n\u201CH-hello? Is someone there? I\u2019m s-sorrr-ry, I suppose my eyes must
    be closed, I can\u2019t see you. I know you're there though. What has happened
    to you, brave knight? I f-f-faile-d, like ev-veryone said that I would. As you
    hear them continue to speak, it becomes clear that the tendrils have worked their
    way into the throat, and deeper still. I thought i-if I could get it back, then
    all would be well. I came so close. What were you here for? It seems so small
    now. So, so small. A family sword. Lost here, so long ago. It's just past here,
    I know. And yet, I know I\u2019ve found my place here, in this little corner.
    To think I thought to be more. So, so small. They seem to slip away again, not
    quite asleep, not quite dead."
