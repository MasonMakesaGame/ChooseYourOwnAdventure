  DialogueText: "You are nothing but an insect, another pathetic soul needing a place
    to put your curses, your hate. You see my form and my abode, and think me deserving.
    BEGONE. \nYou feel the entities will pierce you, forcing you back into the tunnel
    you had just crawled from. As you drag yourself away from it, your brain screams
    with the animal instinct to run, to hide. But the Warrens are deep, dark, and
    far far too old. Another adventurer, lost to mud and the dark. THE END."
