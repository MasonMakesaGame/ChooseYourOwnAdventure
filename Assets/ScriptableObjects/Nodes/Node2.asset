  DialogueText: As you find yourself slipping free of the tunnel, you cast your eyes
    to the small excavation you find yourself in. Small remnants of civilization
    litter the room. You see candles in hand scraped alcoves, a pile of dusty books,
    and a pile of filthy rags. You think they may have once been bedding. As you
    look closer, you see the dull glint of steel. A knight, slumped to their side,
    clutching the ruined blankets to themselves. Looking past the knight, two tunnels
    forward peer out of the darkness like lifeless eyes. The right tunnel invites
    you in, while the left tunnel is completely encased in the same tendrils growing
    from the knight.
