  DialogueText: "As you re-enter the room, you see the knight is still slumped over
    how you left them. As you draw near, you place the sword in their hands. \u201CI-is
    this what I think it is?\u201D Yes, brave knight. I hoped returning it might
    lift your burdens the smallest amount. As the knight's grip tightened on the
    blade, the boiling curses surrounding their form seemed to writhe, like worms
    under the hot sun. Slowly, they retreat into the walls of the antechamber. \u201CI
    can return home with this, stranger. You have done me an impossible service today.
    I swear to you to return this kindness, and pass it forward.\u201D The knight
    struggles to their feet, and towards the entrance threshold you yourself crossed
    only moments ago. As they pass out of view, you see the curses covering the leftmost
    tunnel have cleared, allowing a new way forward. "
